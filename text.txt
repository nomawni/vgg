VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
 with multiple layers. The “deep” refers to the number of layers with VGG-16 or VGG-19 consisting of 16 and 19
  convolutional layers. The VGG architecture is the basis of ground-breaking object recognition models. 
  Developed as a deep neural network, the VGGNet also surpasses baselines on many tasks 
  and datasets beyond ImageNet. Moreover, it is now still one of the most popular image recognition 
  architectures.
